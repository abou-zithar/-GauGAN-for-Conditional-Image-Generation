# GauGAN Implementation with PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of GauGAN using PyTorch. GauGAN is a powerful generative adversarial network (GAN) designed for generating photorealistic images from semantic segmentation maps. This implementation focuses on the following core components:

- **SPADE (Spatially-Adaptive Normalization)**
- **PatchGAN**
- **Residual Block**
- **Gaussian Sampler**

## Introduction

GauGAN is an innovative GAN architecture developed by NVIDIA, capable of transforming semantic segmentation maps into high-quality images. This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of GauGAN, enabling researchers and developers to experiment with and extend the model.

## Components
#### SPADE
SPADE (Spatially-Adaptive Normalization) is a normalization technique that integrates semantic information into the normalization process. It adapts the normalization parameters based on the spatial location and the semantic label at each location.

#### PatchGAN
PatchGAN is a discriminator architecture that classifies patches of an image as real or fake, rather than the entire image. This helps in capturing high-frequency details and improving the quality of generated images.

#### Residual Block
Residual blocks are a fundamental building block of deep networks, allowing the construction of deeper models by using skip connections to add the input of a layer to its output.

#### Gaussian Sampler
The Gaussian sampler is used for generating latent vectors that follow a Gaussian distribution. These vectors are used as inputs for the generator network to produce diverse images.
